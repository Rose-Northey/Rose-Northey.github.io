    <!-- FIRST TOPIC -->
    <article class="odd">
      <div class="text-area">
        <h2>I Am A Programming Looser</h2>
        <h4>That time I got blocked.</h4>
        <br><p>I was trying to make a function that would capitalise the first letter of each word in a sentence but my function kept telling me that the problem was not producing an answer. </p>
        <br><h3>Console.logging</h3>
        <p>I used the console.log() function to show me what the sentence looked like at each step along the process. Everything seemed to be working correctly but the sentence would disappear after I had capitalised its letters. </p>
        <br><h3>Trying Something</h3>
        <p>After finding the step at which it was disappearing and made a dummy function - a very simple function that only tested that one step. I had assumed that the function I was using would automatically return the answer (save the answer before continuing). However, I experimented with adding a manual return command. I then discovered that my code began working.</p>
        <br><h3>Reflecting</h3>
        <p>After completing the problem I took a screenshot of my code and wrote reflections in a searchable document about all the places I had got stuck. I discovered that return functions are needed for an arrow function whenever the code is more than one step. </p>

    <!-- Second TOPIC -->
    <article class="even">
      <div class="text-area">
        <h2>I Am A Programming Genius</h2>
        <h4>That time I elegantly solved a problem.</h4>
        <br><p>I really enjoyed writing code to solve the debee problem. In this problem, you needed to remove all the times “bee” was mentioned in a sentence. </p>
        <br><h3>Pseudocode</h3>
        <p>I wrote all of my code out in plain English before beginning. This helped me to figure out what arrays I needed to make in order to execute the code and what variables I needed. </p>
        <br><h3>Trying Something</h3>
        <p>I was using a .forEach() loop to go through each word one at a time, deleting it if the word was “bee”. However, I found that the .forEach loop wasn’t letting me manipulate its index (which tells you which word of the sentence to look at next). I switched to a for() loop and that allowed me to manipulate the index, allowing me to solve the problem.</p>
        <br><h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>After completing the challenge I wrote about all the parts I had to look up / found tricky in my code reflection journal.</p>

              <h2>So Embarrassment</h2>
              <h4>Feeling too ashamed to ask for help again.</h4>
              <p>I was stuck on the gradebook exercise and had asked both the coach and one of my homegroup members for help. We messaged for a while and while I ended up fixing some things, I didn’t seem to make much progress in understanding why what I had done wasn’t working. </p>
              <br><p>I continued to need help but felt as though I had exceeded the amount of patience that I could ask for from others. I felt embarrassed because I had asked for help on the public homegroup page. But after talking to another student in my homegroup I realized that they had been directly messaging the coach. I tried this and it helped a lot. </p>
