            <h3>IQ</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><p>IQ is our ability to understand logic, patterns, and language skills. </p></li>
              <li><p>IQ has been steadily increasing as people are exposed to more complex technological concepts and ways of thinking. Exposure to IQ-boosting knowledge is taught in school.</p></li>
              <li><p>You can improve your IQ by practicing reasoning skills / learning a new language.</p></li>
              <li><p>Robots are very good at it.</p></li>

            <h3>EQ</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><p>EQ is our ability to understand emotions.</p></li>
              <li><p>EQ is increasing much more slowly. Healthy EQ practices can be learned through culture but are not often formally taught so have been only passively improving. </p></li>
              <li><p>EQ can be learned at any age through exposure to people with good EQ, through mindfulness, reflection, and by practicing various techniques. </p></li>
              <li><p>Robots are trash at it, giving us humans a market advantage.</p></li>

        <h2>Why is EQ Important?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Higher EQ leads to better employability and higher promotions. Therefore higher EQ means higher money therefore I’m sold. EQ also enables us to be happier and have better relationships with others which also seems okay. </p>
