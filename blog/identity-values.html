        <h2>Ethical Decisions</h2>
        <h4>Edith, Agatha and Iris Smith</h4>
        <img class="edith" src="../styles/Edith.png">
        <p>
          I used to have a close friend, Edith. She had an ex called Agatha. Agatha and my friend Edith used to date but they split up after Edith lost interest and also because Agatha cheated on her with someone called Iris Smith. Agatha later moved to New Plymouth and found herself a new girlfriend, Iris (yes, Iris Smith). Agatha and Iris Smith bought a white rat together called Butterbean. Butterbean was extremely snuggly and was deeply loved by all. Agatha, Iris Smith, and Butterbean had been living together for three years. </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          However, for two of those three years, Agatha and my friend Edith had been sexting and sometimes doing a little more than sexting when Edith happened to drive through New Plymouth (which happened surprisingly often considering that it’s New Plymouth). Agatha told my friend Edith that she didn’t love Iris Smith and she was only staying with her because she didn’t want to lose custody of Butterbean. Agatha had half-heartedly tried to break up with Iris once but Iris talked her out of it and then went back to pretending like nothing was wrong. Agatha says that she would break up with Iris for real if my friend Edith proved her love by moving to New Plymouth. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Edith and I organized a group Airbnb to Masterton to celebrate both of our birthdays and Edith asked if she could invite Agatha and share a room with her in the house. Should I have I allowed Edith to bring Agatha and should I have said to both of them?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="value">Compassion</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To my thinking at the time, not one of them was innocent with the exception of Butterbean, who was strictly an indoor rat and therefore had no ecological impact on our wildlife.</li>
          <li>I know that bad relationships form from communication ignorance, untreated mental health problems, and insecurity. All parties contribute to a relationship going sour and staying sour. While it is common for one person to hold more power, that person is often also suffering and acting from a place of pain. It goes against my beliefs to label one person as “the bad one” and they are all deserving of my respect. </li>
          <li>I also loved Edith to bits and didn’t want to damage my friendship with her. I wanted Edith to feel comfortable discussing the situation with me because I knew she didn’t have many people to talk to except for Agatha herself and she had lost a lot of self-esteem in the mess of it all. I also didn’t really know the others at all so it would be weird if I tried to meddle in their lives.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p class="value">Honesty</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I had been in a bad relationship before and none of my friends expressed their opinion until after my ex and I had broken up. It was possible that no one had told Edith how messed up the whole thing was. </li>
          <li>Agatha held the most power in this situation and her actions were going unchecked. Edith did not want to tell Agatha how much the situation was hurting her but I could invite Agatha on the trip and let her know that she was being hurtful. </li>
          <li>Iris Smith had no idea that she was being cheated on. It had been happening for so long and she deserved to know. </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p class="value">Freedom (to make mistakes)</p>
        <ul>
          <li>By telling Iris Smith about the affair or by telling Agatha about how much she was hurting my friend, I would be taking autonomy away from all parties. I could end up creating an even more traumatic situation in the process</li>
          <li>It was also Edith’s birthday and maybe she should be allowed to make her own terrible decisions</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>In the end, I opted to let Edith invite whoever she wanted. I knew that saying no to the trip wouldn’t stop them from having an affair. I also decided it was fair to let Edith know my exact opinion on the whole scenario. I told her that she could do better and deserved someone who put her first and I also told her that her actions were putting Iris Smith into a hurtful situation as well. I was polite to Agatha when she turned up in Masterton but decided it was best not to say anything to her. </p>
      <br>
      <p>I sometimes worry that my responses to situations are conflict avoidant and I know a lot of people would probably have acted in a more drastic way than I did. But I am happy that I’m the type of person who at least says something in an uncomfortable situation. </p>

      <h2>My Culure</h2>
      <h4>How my family and community has affected my values.</h4>
      <p>My family are middle-class Pakeha immigrants. Both of my parents moved to NZ in their teens and don’t have a strong connection to their lineage or the land in a historical sense. My family is sporty, relatively patriarchal, and extremely hard-working. About half the people in my family are self-employed and 3 of my 4 grandparents raised their families on the money which came from self-employment. My family has a strong DIY attitude to solving problems - this is easy when so many in my family are artsy or in trades. I was very lucky to be raised in a space of fun and unconditional love. Sense of humor and kindness are the most important things I look for in my close friends and significant others. My parents never punished me for telling the truth so I can often be blunt when I feel that it’s necessary. Unsolicited advice is something I’m learning not to do</p>
      <br>
      <p>I grew up in Hillcrest / Takapuna / Northcote Auckland New Zealand. The shore has a mix of extreme wealth in places like Devenport and Hillcrest but it also has areas of relative poverty for instance my intermediate was in Northcote, right across the road from a homeless shelter and some of the children in my class lived there. I was extremely lucky to be given many advantages but I also had close friends who had very little. I think this combination of factors has made me value generosity and compassion. </p>
      <br>
      <p>I went to catholic schools from age 9 - 17. I was religious for a large amount of my childhood and often called a “goody good” at school. I’ve always responded well to rules and it’s taken me a long time to see the world in shades of grey. I am naturally trusting of authority because of it. Even though I lost my religion at 15, my ideal system of government is a benevolent dictatorship by a leader who is also clairvoyant. Because I strive to do the right thing for other people it can feel tricky to make quick decisions but I am learning to see that it’s important to make the best decision with the information I have at the time and then reflect upon it later with compassion for myself. </p>
      <br>
      <p>I have often gravitated to creativity and logic to avoid this and there are many jobs I would not even consider doing because I would worry about the amount of reading they would entail. I know this is a weird belief for me to hold given how much I love to waffle on with my writing. For some reason reading and writing sit differently in my head.

      <h2>Strengths and Limitations</h2>
      <h4>Dev Accademy sanctioned bragging and self-dissing.</h4>
      <div class="columns">
        <div>
          <h5>Strengths</h5>
          <p>I am tenacious! I tend to stick with things until I nail them. Sometimes this means that I spend too long trying to independently achieve something I’d be better placed to just ask a question about. But other times it enables me to solve difficult problems that smarter people than me have given up on. This is a really handy skill to have for debugging.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I am a people person. I love engaging with other people’s feelings and getting to know other people’s strengths, weaknesses, and interests. When I’m in a workspace I actively think about how I can bring fun. I just need to balance this with productivity. </p>
          <br>
          <p>I’m patient with teaching people. Being patient with others helps me to feel good about the fact it takes me a while to learn things. This is great for spreading skills amongst a group. </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
          <h5>Limitations</h5>
          <p>I’m not great at reading. I read about as fast as I talk and I find it very difficult to absorb information from written text. I’m subconsciously daunted by walls of text so often I will skip entire sentences or paragraphs without meaning to. It often takes me longer than my peers to learn and I miss key pieces of information in the process. It’s just going to be important to me to reinforce my reading by checking things through with other people, watching videos and trying things out myself. </p>
          <br>
          <p>I have a bit of a complex about being a woman in a male-dominated space. I hate that I have this but I know from my engineering days that it’s there. I can try to mask times when I’m feeling slow, blocked, or incompetent because I feel as though I’m letting down womankind. I know that some people will judge women based on their experience of me and my work but I need to learn to move past this wall in my own mind so that it doesn’t hold me back internally. I am not perfect and I cannot be expected to be a full-time ambassador. </p>
          <br>
          <p>I am a perfectionist. I spent too long trying to master things before I began and not enough time actually trying to complete tasks. This can make things stressful at the last minute for projects if I don’t keep it in check. </p>
          <br>
          <p>I have trouble concentrating on things I’m not obsessed with. I’m so hot and cold with focus. I need to learn to recognize if something isn’t engaging me and take steps to make it more engaging by breaking down a task into smaller steps or adding complexity. Otherwise, I will drag my feet for literal months through a project (speaking from experience in my engineering days and for some of my art projects as well). </p>

      <h2>Working "Productively" With Others</h2>
      <h4>An example of a time when group-work was tricky.</h4>
      <p>Last year I was going to a 5-day festival and we had to organize food ahead of time. There was a group of 12 people but it was just me, another woman and another man. At first, the three of us were just diplomatically talking around the menu for days but no concrete decisions were made and we were getting closer and closer to the festival. Eventually, I stated that I just draft a whole menu and plan out the cooking and then people could let me know whether or not they wanted to change things because otherwise, it seemed nothing would get done in the day we had remaining. The man became very defensive and upset about this strategy and the woman became very worried that I would accidentally offend the man by not taking his input into consideration. I was surprised by how large the reactions were (I thought I was just making things easier for everyone) and realized there were things I didn’t understand.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I had a face-to-face conversation with the woman about the reasons that time was short. I tried to understand her feelings and she said that she was anxious because she had invited everyone and had hosting anxiety. I explained that I only wanted to make things easier not harder and was still happy to be flexible but in order to do that I would need to talk directly to the man about his concerns. I requested that she give me advice about having that conversation. 
      <br>
      <p>I then called the man and introduced myself (we hadn’t met). I asked him questions and it turns out that he was worried I wouldn’t create a nice menu for the vegan/gluten-free group. I told him that I was vegan and he was welcome to change anything from my draft after I had finished it in half an hour. </p>
      <br>
      <p>I gave people the draft and they filled in some gaps for me and everyone was happy with the food which was made in the end. </p>
      <br>
      <p>If I were to do this all over again I would start with a phone call to the man I didn’t know. People get anxious about food and he didn’t know or trust me! I would also have started with a very clear division of roles so that things weren't left to the last minute due to no one taking charge. Setting expectations is important! I was rushing the process because I was worried that there wouldn’t be time to get food at all. Fortunately, it all worked out. </p>
