        <h4>3 learnings about myself and my ego</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>I prop my ego on my achievements and this stunts my ability to learn.</li>
            <li>The combined effect of social anxiety + generic work stress makes my brain function poorly in teamwork settings. This just means that I need to be kind to myself and take more breaks/meditate/do intermittent starjumps when doing these types of activities.  </li>
            <li>My brain gets tired when I code and I can reset it by going for a 15-minute run OR meditating!! </li>

        <h2>Being Friends With Your Computer</h2>
        <h4>Why Empathy and Self-Awareness are Important in Coding and Learning</h4>
        <p>Coding is usually done as a team. So being able to understand and relate to others will help you be happy and productive in team settings. Knowing our own values helps us to understand that these are individual traits, not just “commmon sense” and need to be balanced with other peoples values. Reflection is one of the number 1 ways we can improve ourselves. Learning to code / problem solving can be challenging so learning how to take care of ourselves will make everything easier. </p>

          <h2>I Thought I Left For The Art</h2>
          <h4>A surpring realisation</h4>
          <p>I was pretty confident about my ability to connect to others / work well as a team. But doing the core learning has helped me to realize that I have a lot to improve on. In my past life as a mechanical engineer I had a pretty fixed mindset, would get stressed and struggle to deal with it promptly and would pin my ego on my achievements. My art career has mostly been solitary so I haven’t needed to deal with these issues but they are still present in me. But they are also FIXABLE! Yay!!! 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The most challenging aspect of core learning was admitting this to myself. </p>

    <div class="text-area">
      <h2>Teaching Us How to Human Better</h2>
      <h4>Why core learning isn't a big ol waste of time</h4>
      <p>You dev academy people seem to want us to get a job after the course. Employers are looking for people who know how to work with humans. </p>
  <br>
  <p>I'm pretty introspective and whenever I do poetry / comedy gigs, that's me sharing my feelings for profit. So I was mostly pretty comfortable with doing the core content in this course. I love having a wee think about thinking!</p>
<br>
<p>I feel like the time I’ve spent learning about myself has answered some anxieties about getting back into the workforce. I may have run into all the same problems again and then had to quit without knowing why (which would mean the whole course would be a waste). It's difficult to put the time aside to learn something that doesn’t feel time-pressing. So I’m glad someone else was making me do it! </p>
