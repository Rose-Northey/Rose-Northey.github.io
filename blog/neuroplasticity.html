        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
        <h4>Knowing about neuroplasticity is the placebo pill you need to promote neuroplasticity in your own brain. </h4>
        <p>Neuroplasticity enables us to learn new skills. Not only that but it changes the actual structure of the brain. If we take care of ourselves while we are learning to parts of our brain that we use more will become super hench - actually increasing in size over time. The connections between the neurons we often use will grow stronger meaning that it requires less effort to think like a programmer over time. </p>
        <br>
        <p>My family has a history of dementia. If I adopt healthy habits which promote neuroplasticity I can avoid the symptoms. This is because when your brain is neuroplastic, it can form new connections after the old ones die off. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Things that have been shown to increase your neuroplasticity...</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>go running</li>
          <li>learn a new language</li>
          <li>dabble in new skills</li>
          <li>minimize stress</li>
          <li>get good sleep</li>
          <li>have sex (but not at the expense of sleep)</li>
          <li>be a nun (but not at the expense of sex)</li>
          <li>cultivate a healthy social life</li>
          <li>be creative</li>
          <li>listen to music</li>
          <li>meditate often</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
        <p>A Growth mindset is the power of thinking positively about your brain’s ability to learn.  It’s the difference between “I can’t do this because my brain isn’t capable of it” and “I can’t do this yet”. When we have a growth mindset it means that we can more easily learn more skills. </p>
        <br>
        <p>My mum tells everyone that when I was little I asked her not to praise me for my successes. Baby Rose didn’t know it but she was actually protecting herself from developing a fixed mindset. When we are praised for our successes, we begin to define ourselves around them which makes us panic and switch off if we come across something which we cannot initially do.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It’s important that I don’t expect myself to be perfect while I am learning. I need to praise myself for my persistence and my ability to look after myself during my learning journey. </p>
        <br>
        <p>It’s also super important to celebrate the successes of others in my course and not see their successes as a threat. Being surrounded by driven, capable programmers will help me improve as well.</p>

        <h2>Changes to my Learning Plan</h2>
        <h4>I have added these into my learning plan in pink text.</h4>
        <p>I would like to add another bullet point to my Limitations</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li class="amendment"><strong>Vanity</strong>
            <br>
            <p>Because I have a background in Engineering and have been told that I’m a high achiever I feel pressure to succeed in the eyes of others. Unchecked this will stunt my learning.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>I would like to add another bullet point to my core skills wishlist. </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="amendment">remove “capable” from my sense identity and replace it with “strategic” 
          </li>
          I would like to focus more on my ability to learn things than the result that I obtain. I want to be better at changing the plan to adapt to circumstances and down-scoping work when it’s not actually necessary. 
        </ul>
      <br>
      <p>I would like to add another paragraph to ‘Managing My Workload’. </p>
        <ul>
          <p class="amendment">I want to do half an hour of exercise per day. I usually get at least ten minutes of exercise by walking to the bus etc. but I want to do more to make sure my brain is as neuroplastic as possible. 
          </p>
