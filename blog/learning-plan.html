            <h2>My Long Term Goal</h2>
            <h4>How does studying software help me make art?</h4>
            <p>I would love to obtain the money. You can use money to buy dogs and to prevent panic attacks which makes money the best. My goal is to earn 3x the living wage and only work for half of the year. Currently, the living wage is 26 NZD. This means I need to make 81k per year / 624NZD per day. This income would enable me to make art without financial pressure. Then I can write my weird silly-putty apocalypse novel. </p>

            <h2>Managing My Workload</h2>
            <h4>My committment to not being a soggy liability.</h4>
            <p>In order to be a good worker I am going to try to get good sleep, spend some time outside each day, and not work more than 8 hours per day if I can help it. This will mean it is crucial to put my headphones in and my head down when I need to work. I will use my timer when I get stuck and ensure I spend no more than 20 minutes trying to solve a problem before I ask for help. </p>
            <br>
            <p>When I notice that I am stressed I am going to physically step away from my desk. I will do some breathing exercises or starjumps or even go for a walk and talk to someone. I will ask for help if this happens multiple times on the same problem.</p>

            <p>Imagine you turn your object into a fly. Then you take a piece of honey and smear it onto your browser window. The fly leaves its original location as if it were never there. It comes all the way up onto your computer screen to where you put the honey. </p>
            <img src="../styles/sprint2/f.png" class="code">
            <p>e.g. We ask fixed block F to move 50px across from the left. It remains at the top of the browser even when we scroll the webpage. We can make the z-index higher to ensure that F is right at the top, hovering over everything or make the z-index lower so that it slips beneath other elements as we scroll. </p>
