            <h2>My Long Term Goal</h2>
            <h4>How does studying software help me make art?</h4>
            <p>I would love to obtain the money. You can use money to buy dogs and to prevent panic attacks which makes money the best. My goal is to earn 3x the living wage and only work for half of the year. Currently, the living wage is 26 NZD. This means I need to make 81k per year / 624NZD per day. This income would enable me to make art without financial pressure. Then I can write my weird silly-putty apocalypse novel. </p>

            <h2>Managing My Workload</h2>
            <h4>My committment to not being a soggy liability.</h4>
            <p>In order to be a good worker I am going to try to get good sleep, spend some time outside each day, and not work more than 8 hours per day if I can help it. This will mean it is crucial to put my headphones in and my head down when I need to work. I will use my timer when I get stuck and ensure I spend no more than 20 minutes trying to solve a problem before I ask for help. </p>
            <br>
            <p>When I notice that I am stressed I am going to physically step away from my desk. I will do some breathing exercises or starjumps or even go for a walk and talk to someone. I will ask for help if this happens multiple times on the same problem.</p>

            <h4>War against the unholy union of my perfectionism and tenacity.</h4>
            <p>I am going to use a 20-minute timer to ensure that I ask for help in a timely way. I will first reach out to my fellow students and then reach out to the facilitators. </p>

            <h2>Expectations from the Facilitation Team</h2>
            <h4>My committment to not being a soggy liability.</h4>
            <p>I have a fragile artist's ego so I expect facilitators to not put me down when I ask for help.  I expect the facilitators to be patient with me when it inevitably takes me a while to understand new things or read new information. I expect facilitators to respect my need to take time off from work.</p>
