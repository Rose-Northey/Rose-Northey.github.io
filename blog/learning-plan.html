            <h2>Managing My Workload</h2>
            <h4>My committment to not being a soggy liability.</h4>
            <p>In order to be a good worker I am going to try to get good sleep, spend some time outside each day, and not work more than 8 hours per day if I can help it. This will mean it is crucial to put my headphones in and my head down when I need to work. I will use my timer when I get stuck and ensure I spend no more than 20 minutes trying to solve a problem before I ask for help. </p>
            <br>
            <p>When I notice that I am stressed I am going to physically step away from my desk. I will do some breathing exercises or starjumps or even go for a walk and talk to someone. I will ask for help if this happens multiple times on the same problem.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="amendment">I want to do half an hour of exercise per day. I usually get at least ten minutes of exercise by walking to the bus etc. but I want to do more to make sure my brain is as neuroplastic as possible.</p>

                <p><strong>Reflection Pre-Bootcamp:</strong>
                    Learning how to minimise stress and keeping my cool will be my biggest non-technical challenge. Battling my brain to try and develop a healthy mindset towards my own abilities so that I praise myself work work done instead of being set in the ego rolercoaster. 
I would like to learn how to prioritise tasks before doing stretch tasks. I would like to take time to plan before hurtling in.

            <h4>My committment to not being a soggy liability.</h4>
            <p>I have a fragile artist's ego so I expect facilitators to not put me down when I ask for help.  I expect the facilitators to be patient with me when it inevitably takes me a while to understand new things or read new information. I expect facilitators to respect my need to take time off from work.</p>
